# TCL-Learning-for-Synthesis-Timing-Analysis-Open-Source-Tools
This repository documents my TCL scripting journey for synthesis and timing analysis using open-source tools like Yosys and OpenTimer on Ubuntu. It includes insights from the VLSI System Design (VSD) TCL Workshop and shares scripts, notes, and practical experiences in digital design automation.

## DAY 1, I have Setup the Lab

Today, is a fun starting and I have learning the basics of TCL,

TCL is abbrevated as Tool Command Language

TCL (Tool Command Language) is a high-level scripting language created by John Ousterhout in the late 1980s.

Usage: TCL is used to scripting and automation in VLSI Industries and config the tools. 

## Advantages of Using TCL in EDA 
1. Automates repetitive design steps.
2. Ensures consistency and reduces manual errors.
3. Allows parameterized and reusable design scripts.
4. Integrates easily with tool command consoles.
5. Enables batch mode execution (no GUI needed).
